# Employee Management System - Version 1
 A simple C++ console-based program that manages employee records. This project was developed as part of my journey to learn fundamental programming concepts, including arrays, loops, and conditionals, as well as version control with Git and GitHub.

## Features

1. **Add New Employee**
   - Allows users to input an employee's name, age, salary, and gender.
   
2. **Print All Employees**
   - Displays a list of all employees with their details.
   
3. **Delete Employees by Age**
   - Removes employees whose age falls within a specified range.
   
4. **Update Salary by Name**
   - Updates the salary of an employee based on their name.

5. **Exit Program**
   - Provides an option to exit the program gracefully.

### Concepts Demonstrated

- **Arrays**: Used to store and manage employee data.
- **Loops**: Implemented for traversing arrays and handling operations.
- **Conditional Statements**: Applied to menu selection and data filtering.
- **Data Shifting**: Performed when deleting employee records.
- **User Input and Output**: Practiced using `cin` and `cout` for interaction.
- **Version Control**: The project helped me learn Git and GitHub for managing code changes and versions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Compilation and Execution

1. Clone the Repository

   git clone https://github.com/CEOAntar/Employee-Management-System-v1.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
	
   cd Employee-Management-System-v1

3. Compile the Program

   g++ -o employee_management employee_management.cpp

4. Run the Program

   ./employee_management


### Usage

Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the following options:

    Add New Employee: Enter employee details to add to the system.
    Print All Employees: View the list of all employee records.
    Delete Employees by Age: Remove employees within a specified age range.
    Update Salary by Name: Modify the salary of an employee based on their name.
    Exit: Close the program.

### Example Interaction

Enter your choice:
1) Enter new employee
2) Print all employees
3) Delete by age
4) Update salary by name
5) Exit

### Learning Outcomes

    .Gained practical experience with arrays and data manipulation.
    .Improved my skills in C++ programming, including working with loops and conditionals.
    .Learned the basics of version control, using Git and GitHub for the first time to track changes and collaborate on code.

### Future Improvements

    .Implement error handling for user inputs.
    .Add file handling to persist employee data across sessions.
    .Use more advanced data structures for better performance and flexibility.


### Version 2 Updates

- Modular Design  
  - Separate functions for adding, deleting, displaying, and updating employee records.
  - Improved menu with structured user choice validation.

- Fixed Issues  
  - Refined "Delete by Age" feature with enhanced data shifting to prevent errors during record deletions.

- Enhanced User Experience  
  - Clearer input prompts and validation checks for better user interaction.

Features

1. Add Employee: Capture new employee details, including name, age, salary, and gender.
2. Display All Employees: Retrieve and display all employee records.
3. Delete by Age: Remove employees within a specified age range.
4. Update Salary: Modify an employeeâ€™s salary by searching for their name.
5. Modular Code Structure: Organized using functions to promote reusability and readability.

Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience in:
- Code Modularity: Organizing functionality into distinct functions for clarity.
- Handling Edge Cases: Managing potential issues during record deletion and data shifting.
- Iterative Improvement: Understanding the impact of code refinement on usability and structure.

Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Platform: Console Application
